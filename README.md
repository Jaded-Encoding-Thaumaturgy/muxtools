## How do I use this?

You might wanna check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Irrational-Encoding-Wizardry/vs-muxtools/wiki) in the [vs-muxtools](https://github.com/Irrational-Encoding-Wizardry/vs-muxtools) repo.

## Installation

Git is always the most updated one obviously but I can't guarantee that everything is in a working state.

You can also grab the lastest stable ish versions from pip.
